# QA³: Quantum-Accelerated AI Agent

QA³ (Quantum-Accelerated AI Agent) is a cutting-edge hybrid quantum-classical computing platform that provides intuitive tools for quantum computational exploration and learning. This agent combines the power of quantum computing with advanced AI to deliver superior search, browsing, and task execution capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Quantum-Enhanced Search**: Search across 20+ real sources with quantum acceleration for relevance ranking and result optimization.
- **Autonomous Web Browsing**: Browser automation with natural language task processing for complex web interactions.
- **Task History Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of tasks with performance metrics and comparison of quantum vs. classical execution.
- **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities for offline functionality, installation, and enhanced user experience.
- **Quantum Circuit Integration**: Real quantum circuit implementations for performance advantages in specific tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **PennyLane**: Quantum circuit simulation and optimization
- **Azure Quantum**: Integration with real quantum hardware (when available)
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface
- **Python 3.11**: Core programming language
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline capabilities and installation support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- PennyLane quantum computing library
- Streamlit for the web interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qa3-agent.git
cd qa3-agent
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run enhanced_quantum_agent_demo.py
```

## Usage

The QA³ agent provides different interfaces for various use cases:

### Chat Interface

Use the chat interface to interact with the agent using natural language. You can ask questions, request information, or instruct the agent to perform tasks.

```
"Find the latest quantum computing research papers from arXiv"
"Search for software engineering jobs at Microsoft"
"Go to example.com and extract the main content"
```

### Search Interface

The search interface provides direct access to the quantum-enhanced search capabilities across 20+ sources. You can enable deep search for comprehensive results or use standard search for faster response.

### Web Browsing Interface

The web browsing interface allows you to instruct the agent to perform complex web tasks like:

```
"Find job listings for AI engineers at Google"
"Navigate to Microsoft's homepage and extract product information"
"Check the latest news about quantum computing on TechCrunch"
```

## Quantum Advantage

The QA³ agent leverages quantum computing for several key advantages:

1. **Search Acceleration**: Quantum-inspired algorithms provide up to O(√N) speedup for search tasks compared to classical O(N) algorithms.
2. **Relevance Ranking**: Quantum circuits perform enhanced ranking of search results based on multiple features.
3. **Optimization**: Quantum algorithms help optimize complex tasks more efficiently than classical methods.
