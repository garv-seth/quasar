  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split
  │ (python_full_version >= '3.12.4'):
  ╰─▶ Because crawl4ai==0.4.0 depends on pillow>=10.4,<11.dev0 and
      datasetrising==1.0.4 depends on pillow==10.0.0, we can conclude that
      crawl4ai==0.4.0 and datasetrising==1.0.4 are incompatible.
      And because only datasetrising<=1.0.4 is available, we can conclude that
      crawl4ai==0.4.0 and datasetrising>=1.0.4 are incompatible.
      And because your project depends on crawl4ai==0.4.0 and
      datasetrising>=1.0.4, we can conclude that your project's requirements
      are unsatisfiable.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution,
        provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.
